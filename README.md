# OpenVHook
OpenVHook is a standalone script hook for Grand Theft Auto V

## Features
- Custom *.asi loader which is compatible with existing GTA:V mods
- Ability to create standalone mods/scripts
- Lots of other stuff I can't think of right now

## Credits
[NTAuthority/citizenMP](http://tohjo.eu/citidev/citizenmp) Most of the code is from them. I only changed it up here and there and added my own improvements.
